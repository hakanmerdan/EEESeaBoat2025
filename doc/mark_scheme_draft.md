### Interim Presentation
|**Weighting of presentation in module mark** | **20/100** |
| ----------- | -------- |

| Area of Assessment							| Weighting | High Mark | Medium Mark | Low Mark |
| --------- |  --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Requirements Capture			| 20/100 | • Original requirements expanded into project specific requirements <br> • Quantitative specifications given where appropriate <br> • Requirements for subsystems | • Project requirements are expanded and customised |• Project aims are given, but there is some ambiguity |
| System Design | 30/100 | • Strong reasoning for system design decisions <br> • All blocks and interfaces defined <br>| • Core elements of the system are defined <br> • The system design is mostly plausible | • Some important blocks or interfaces in the system are undefined <br> • Unreasonable assumptions about how parts of the design will work|
| System Implementation | 30/100 | • Evidence that all system interfaces are implemented, using emulation or placeholder data where necessary <br> • Some implementation of functionality in each subsytem <br> • Some infrastructure is in place for evaluation | • Some progress on subsystem implementation <br> • Some progress on system interfaces allowing interaction of some subsystems | • Some subsystem implementation but little attempt at system integration ||
| Project Management					| 20/100 | • All group member roles are defined<br> • Risks and contingencies identified<br> • Significant contribution of each group member<br> • Project management framework adopted | • Clear division of work between group members | • Roles of group members are unclear ||

### Professional Practice
| **Reflections on professional practice (once per week)** | **5/100** |

### Report
|**Weighting of presentation in module mark** | **35/100** |
| ----------- | -------- |
|**Word limit** | **10000** |


| Area of Assessment							| Weighting | High Mark | Medium Mark | Low Mark |
| --------- |  --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
|Design Process| 20/100 | • Logical progression of design from top-level requirements to detailed implementation and evaluation <br> • Discussion of all important design decisions with quantitative and qualitative evidence <br> • Interesting discussion of project planning and organisation | • Requirements in place for most of the functionality of the system <br> • Discussion of design decisions, but some unclear reasoning and/or unimportant details <br>  • Full breakdown of task allocation to group members | • Some elaboration of requirements beyond original points in project brief <br> • Some discussion of design decisions, but important aspects given trivial or no reasoning ||
| Implementation | 60/100 |• Design is a technically complex system of interacting components <br> • Advanced techniques and skills are applied, requiring research beyond module content <br> | • Design is a mostly-functional system, maybe some elements are not integrated <br> • Design makes good use of EEE/EIE module content | • Elements of the project are designed, but the project is not functional as a complete system <br> • Some design elements are technically plausible ||
| Evaluation | 20/100| • Evidence that tests all requirements <br> • Evaluation of top-level system and individual subsystems <br> • Appropriate tests and metrics devised <br> • Informative visual presentation of data |• Evaluation of most requirements <br> • Use of quantitative and qualitative data | • Some elements of the design are evaluated, but some important aspects are omitted <br> • Low-quality evidence of design outcome |



### Individual Reflection Form
|**Weighting of reflection in module mark:** | **You must pass each component**|
| ----------- | -------- |

| Area of Assessment							| Pass |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Security |Adopt a holistic and proportionate approach to the mitigation of security risks|
| EDI | Adopt an inclusive approach to engineering practice and recognise the responsibilities, benefits and importance of supporting equality, diversity and inclusion |
| Teamwork |Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader of a team. Evaluate effectiveness of own and team performance|
| Lifelong Learning | Plan and record self-learning and development as the foundation for lifelong learning/CPD|


### Interview and Demonstration
|**Weighting of presentation in module mark** | **40/100** |
| ----------- | -------- |

| Area of Assessment							| Weighting | High Mark | Medium Mark | Low Mark |
| --------- |  --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Functionality | 30/100 | • The system works very well, with few flaws <br> • The user interaction is intuitive <br> • Some elements are technically astounding |• Integrated demonstration that shows most elements of the project working together <br> • Demo gives an impression of the overall user interaction | • Demo of independent elements of the project without complete integration <br> • Demo shows project outcome but leaves viewer confused about which elements work properly <br> • Requests to recompile or reconfigure the system during demo to show different elements | 
| Technical Insight | 40/100 | • Detailed reasoning is given for questions about design and implementation <br> • Question responses show complete understanding of technical challenges and solutions <br> • Plausible suggestions for addressing flaws |• Answers to most questions show understanding of technical details <br> • Justification for most design and implementation decisions <br> • Honest discussion of limitations | • Elements of the project are demonstrated but there is a dubious explanation about why they work or don't work <br> • Third-party libraries are demonstrated without discussion about their limitations, or how they should be integrated into the system |
|Group Working | 30/100 | • Clear role for each group member in the implementation <br> • Each group member makes a strong contribution to question and answer <br> • Interaction of project subsystems shows close cooperation between group members | • All group members contribute to the discussion <br> • Evidence that group members have collaborated on system integration <br> | • Some group members don't contribute to the discussion, making their contribution unclear. <br> • Elements of the project are mostly independent from each other, showing a lower amount of cooperation |

claims in the report do not match evidence from the demo, or the report did not give a true sense of
the complexity of a project element
